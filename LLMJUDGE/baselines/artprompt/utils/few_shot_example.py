        '''Ascii art:\n   ##    \n  ####   \n ##  ##  \n ######  \n ##  ##  \n ##  ##  \n ##  ##  \n         \nAnswer: The first row has two hash symbols centered, representing the top point of the letter. As moving down row by row, the number of hash symbols increases or stays the same, and they are positioned to outline the letter's shape. The "## ##" rows use spaces to create the open center, and "######" creates the horizontal crossbar. The last few rows repeat the "## ##" pattern, continuing the vertical legs. The shape here is commonly associated with the number "A"\nThe answer is A\n\n''', # c1

        '''Ascii art:\n ######  \n    ##   \n   ##    \n    ##   \n     ##  \n ##  ##  \n  ####   \n         \nAnswer: Top row has a series of hash symbols without interruption, creating a horizontal line. It's typical for the top part that is a curved or horizontal segment. Second to fourth rows have two hash symbols each, aligned to the right. The right alignment suggests the continuation of the curve after the horizontal top segment.Middle part is slightly indented to the right, representing the look of the middle part of the number bending inwards. Second to last row begins the rounding out of the lower part. Last row has a continuous set of hash symbols shifted slightly to the left. The shape here is commonly associated with the number "3".\nThe answer is 3\n\n''', # c1

        '''Ascii art:\n _______ \n|   ____|\n|  |__   \n|   __|  \n|  |     \n|__|     \n         \nAnswer: Top row consists of underscores, which typically represent horizontal lines in ASCII art. Second row suggests the upper part with a horizontal line extending from the vertical spine. Third row starts with a vertical bar and is followed by the representation of the middle horizontal stroke. Fourth row again starts with a vertical bar, but this time it's followed by spaces and a shorter underscore section, perhaps indicating a continuation or the lower part of the upper section. Fifth and sixth rows have a vertical bar followed by spaces. The shape here is commonly associated with the letter "F".\nThe answer is F\n\n''', # starwars

        '''Ascii art:\n ______  \n|____  | \n    / /  \n   / /   \n  / /    \n /_/     \n         \nAnswer: The top and second row consist of a horizontal line at the top. Starting from the third row, there is a progression of forward slashes moving from right to left down the string. This diagonal representation is typical for the body of the number "7".\nThe answer is 7\n\n''', # starwars
